class _SPARQLNode(object):
    """
    The SPARQL implementation is based on the creation of a tree, each
    level for each statement in the 'where' clause of SPARQL.

    Each node maintains a 'binding' dictionary, with the variable
    names and either a None if not yet bound, or the binding
    itself. The method 'expand' tries to make one more step of binding
    by looking at the next statement: it takes the statement of the
    current node, binds the variables if there is already a binding,
    and looks at the triple store for the possibilities. If it finds
    valid new triplets, that will bind some more variables, and
    children will be created with the next statement in the 'where'
    array with a new level of bindings. This is done for each triplet
    found in the store, thereby branching off the tree. If all
    variables are already bound but the statement, with the bound
    variables, is not 'true' (ie, there is no such triple in the
    store), the node is marked as 'clash' and no more expansion is
    made; this node will then be thrown away by the parent. If I{all}
    children of a node is a clash, then it is marked as a clash
    itself.

    At the end of the process, the leaves of the tree are searched; if
    a leaf is such that:

      - all variables are bound
      - there is no clash

    then the bindings are returned as possible answers to the query.

    The optional clauses are treated separately: each 'valid' leaf is
    assigned an array of expansion trees that contain the optional
    clauses (that may have some unbound variables bound at the leaf,
    though).
