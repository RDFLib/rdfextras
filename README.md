RDFExtras is a collection of packages providing extras based on RDFLib. These
include a tools package and several "non-core-rdflib" store implementations.

RDFExtras includes: 

 * A pure-python SPARQL implementation for in-memory stores or other store
   that do not provide their own SPARQL implementation. 
 * A set of commandline utilities: rdfpipe, rdf2dot, rdfs2dot, csv2rdf

Dependencies: 

 * RDFLib>=3.2.1
 * For SPARQL: pyparsing
